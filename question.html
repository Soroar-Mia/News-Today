    <h2>What is difference between var, let and const in JavaScript?</h2>
    <P>
        <ol>
            <li>let: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
                Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is usually denoted by curly braces {}.</li>
            <li>var: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
                Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global variables are available throughout your entire code.</li>
            <li>const: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that can’t be reassigned.
                Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are actually variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Difference Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions?</h2>
        <P>
            Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this . The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.
            Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences between them.
        </P>
        <h2>what is difference between map, foreach, filter, find?</h2>
    <P>
        .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
        .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
        .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
    </P>
        <h2>how to use template string in javascript?</h2>
        
    <P>
        Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.
    </P>
